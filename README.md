# My First Neural Network #
This was a practice exercise inpired by 3Blue1Brown's video on the same topic. I began to read up on the actual math and vector multiplication required to perform this, and it was actually fairly simple. 
With my knowledge of unsupervised machine learning algorithms, I decided to use numpy to speed up the computation, on the MNIST dataset.
